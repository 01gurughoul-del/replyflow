# What's next

---

## Done so far

- **Week 1:** API + WhatsApp lesson, Railway + Vercel + Gemini, .env, 1 restaurant visit  
- **Week 2:** Dependencies installed, `week2_gemini_reply.py` runs and gets a reply from Gemini (restaurant-bot style).  
  - Run it anytime: `cd week2` then `python week2_gemini_reply.py`, type a message or press Enter for demo.

---

## Next: Week 3–4 – real bot (WhatsApp + database)

1. **WhatsApp:** Use a provider (e.g. **WATI** – wati.io) so real customer messages hit your server. Your server will run on **Railway** and call Gemini (same flow as Week 2).  
2. **Database:** Add a DB (e.g. PostgreSQL on Railway) to store restaurants, menus, conversations, orders.  
3. **One restaurant first:** One WhatsApp number, one menu, orders saved in DB. Then add more restaurants.

When you're ready, we can do this step by step in a new folder (e.g. `phase/week3` or `phase/bot`).

## Or: get your first customer first (Part 4)

- Finish **4 more restaurant visits** (you did 1).  
- Build a **simple demo**: e.g. you text a number, bot replies (even without full WhatsApp Business API – e.g. a shared demo number or a simple web form that sends to Gemini and shows the reply).  
- **Pitch:** “2 weeks free trial – AI takes orders on WhatsApp.”  
- Get **1 paying customer** (Rs. 5,000/month), then improve the product from their feedback.

## Summary

| Option | What you do |
|--------|-------------|
| **A – Build more** | Week 3–4: add WhatsApp (WATI) + database, full bot for one restaurant. |
| **B – Sell first** | Part 4: more visits, simple demo, pitch, get 1 customer, then improve. |

You can do A then B, or B then A. The guide says: build something basic, get 1 customer, then improve. So B is valid early too.

When you want to continue, say **“let’s do Week 3”** or **“let’s do Part 4 / first customer”** and we’ll go step by step.
