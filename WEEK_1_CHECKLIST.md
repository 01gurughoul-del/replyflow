# Week 1 Checklist – Learning Phase (No Coding Yet)

**Goal by end of Week 1:** You understand what WhatsApp API, AI API, and databases are. You don't need to know HOW to code them yet.

---

## Day 1–2: Learn (taught by your AI – no videos)

- [ ] **Read: "What is an API?"**  
  - Open **WEEK_1_LESSON.md** in this folder.  
  - Read Part 1. You just need to get: *API = waiter between your app and another service.*

- [ ] **Read: "WhatsApp Business API basics"**  
  - Same file, Part 2.  
  - You just need to get: *Messages come in through the API to your server; replies go out from your server through the API to WhatsApp. Use Business API (e.g. WATI), not personal WhatsApp.*

## Day 3: Create Accounts

- [ ] **AI API – use FREE option (earn first, then invest)**  
  - **Recommended: Google Gemini (no credit card)**  
    - Go to: **https://aistudio.google.com**  
    - Sign in with Google → **Get API key** → copy and save it.  
  - See **FREE_AI_SETUP.md** in this folder for Gemini + Groq (backup).  
  - We'll build the bot with Gemini; you can add Claude later when you're earning.

- [x] **Railway** (where your server will run later) – *you did this*
- [x] **Vercel** (where your dashboard will run later) – *you did this*

## Day 4–5: Real-World Research

- [ ] **Visit 5 restaurants** (or 5 places that take orders – cafes, shops).  
  - You did **1** – try for 4 more when you can (off-peak, 3–5 PM).  
  - Just **observe**: How do they take orders? Phone? WhatsApp? Paper?  
  - Note: Do they get overwhelmed? Do they miss orders? Would a bot help?

---

## Done?

- [x] **Cursor** – you're already using it.  
When the rest is done, you're ready for **Week 2**: build your first "receive message → reply with AI" script using **Gemini (free)** in Cursor.

**Next file:** We'll use `WEEK_2_CHECKLIST.md` when you start Week 2.
