# Use a FREE AI – Earn First, Then Invest

You don't need to pay for Claude. Use a free AI until you have paying customers.

---

## Best option: Google Gemini (recommended)

- **Cost:** Free. No credit card needed.
- **Where:** **https://aistudio.google.com** (Google AI Studio)
- **What you get:** API key in 1 minute. Use with any Google account.
- **Free limits (approx.):** Around 1,000 requests/day, 15 requests/minute. Enough for learning + 1–2 test restaurants.
- **Urdu / Roman Urdu:** Works. Same idea as Claude: you send instructions + message, it replies.

### Get your Gemini API key

1. Go to **https://aistudio.google.com**
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Click **Get API key** (or Create API key). Copy and save it somewhere safe.
4. Use this key in your bot instead of Claude. The code is almost the same; only the API URL and key change.

When you earn and want to invest later, you can add Claude (or keep using Gemini paid tier). Start free.

## Backup option: Groq

- **Cost:** Free tier.
- **Where:** **https://console.groq.com**
- **What you get:** Fast responses, Llama models. Free tier: many requests per day.
- **Urdu:** Llama models understand multiple languages. Good for bots.

Sign up, get API key, use in your code. Same idea: send message + instructions, get reply.
